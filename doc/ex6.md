# Exercise 6: Analyse cumulative precipitation VS Altitude (DTM)
Developing Exercise 6 Cumulative PP vs Alt...

In this activity you should compare the altitude of the weather stations sensed from the DTM 50m 
resolution layer with the altitude provided in the stations metadata. Are there any differences? 
Where do they come from? 

Additionally, you will start gathering all the knowledge learnt from the previous exercises.
It is time to start working on your discussions. Firstly, focus on the cumulative precipitation
values at the end of the investigation period (2017-08-17?). Compare the measured values with
the altitude of the stations from the DTM layer. Are there any differences? Can you find any patterns?
How can you explain it?

You should consider the following:
- You can directly compare the altitude values by using a nx2 table. Where n is the number of 
weather stations compared.
- Make sure to somehow indicate strong differences. You should try to find an explanation for them and
indicate which measure should be more reliable.
- Figure out if you can plot final value of cumulative precipitation VS Altitude of weather station.
- Is the result what you expected? Is there a tendency? are there outliers? Make sure to include
all that in your discussion.
