# Exercise 6: Discuss different SMI dynamics in Olpe and Hochsauerlankreis

Pay special attention at the strong differences
of SMI in the counties of Olpe (OE) and Hochsauerlandkreis (HSK) during the first two months of the study period.
What makes them so different from the last two months of the study period? Why is Hochsauerlandkreis less affected in terms
of SMI in comparison to the other twelve counties? Use the knowledge and observation gained from previous exercises to formulate hypotheses and to discuss them.
