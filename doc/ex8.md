# Exercise 8: Roof Tops of Industrial Buildings
Working on description Roof Tops of Industrial Buildings:

A new industrial building is planned in the county of Olpe. 
The water raining on the roof of the building has to be drained. 
To plan the drainage you have to determine the total amount of water collected by the roof in the 
four months May to August 2017. Assume that the annual precipitation sum is approximately 3 x the 
precipitation sum over the four months. 

Unfortunately you just have a scanned map of the roof plan which you have to georeference and 
digitize first to determine the roof area and location. 
Then you have to multiply the cumulative annual precipitation for the location of the roof with the roof 
size to get the collected total annual volume in mÂ³/year. 
To get the precipitation falling on the roof you can assume that the precipitation 
does not vary across the roof. 
Unfortunately, you do not have a precipitation station at the location of the planned building. 

There are serveral methods to estimate the local precipitation from measurements at the distributed 
DWD stations. The simplest way would be the method of nearest neighbor. 
A more sophisticated method is that of a linear estimator with weights proportional 
to inverse distances between the location of interest and the precipitation stations around.
 Find out how this works and determine the annual cumulative precipitation at the location of the
 new building as well as the total rain water volume collected by the roof during 2017. 
 
 How much water do you have to drain?
